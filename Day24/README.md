1. What is a Git repo?
   Git repo is a directory containing files and sub-directories, and Git storage (.git). The benefits of creating repos are the ability to systematically track versions, revert to previous versions, enables collaboration with colleagues, and compare versions at different points in time.
   To create a new repo, use git init name(replace with actual name of the repo).
