This is day 21 of learning Python

Topic: Introduction to Shell
Summary: Shell is the outermost layer of the operating system. It is the user interface that allows to talk to the Kernel (CPU, RAM, Storage). When people say "The Shell", they usually mean the Command Line Interface(CLI).
Examples of commands:
pwd (short for "print working directory") - This prints the absolute path of your current working directory, which is where the shell runs commands and looks for files by default.
ls (short for "listing") - lists the contents of your current directory (the one displayed by pwd).
cd (stands for "change directory") - To change your currect location to any directory.
cp (short for "copy") - to copy files and move them into other directories.
mv (short for "move") - to move files from one directory to another.
